	<h2>About <span>Thoughts, questions and some answers</span></h2>
	<p>
		This blog is currently designed to express my ideas. I believe writing is an important and
		rewarding skill for your wellbeing and intellect. I like to write and think about the <strong
			>Universe</strong
		>, <strong>Life</strong>, <strong>Physics</strong>, <strong>Humanity</strong> and even
		<strong>Philosophy</strong>. My plan is to eventually do and solve some of the things I discuss,
		but for the meantime I shall write about it. Writing is a great tool which helps people
		communicate, which is also why this is aimed to improve my writing skills (If you notice my vile
		writing in the beginning; give me time). Anyway, checkout the goal of this project also, if you
		are interested. Feel free to contact me at
		<a href="mailto:hello@airnotice.co">hello@airnotice.co</a> for queries. Have a good day ;)
