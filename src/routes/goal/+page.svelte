	<h2>Goal <span>for Thoughts, questions and some answers</span></h2>
	<p>
		I imagine <strong>Thoughts, questions and some answers</strong> as a blog where anyone can write
		what they think. I want this blog to be different to others, where it is reader focused,
		allowing the reader to comment on specific questions, thoughts or answers. This will allow
		everyone to share opinions and ideas. Currently this is just me writing, however if people
		actually read this, then I will enable accounts and build a full CMS. I would love your
		feedback, contact me at: <a href="mailto:hello@airnotice.co">hello@airnotice.co</a>.
